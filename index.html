        <p>Established in memory of Elizabeth Schmerling by her family and generously supported by friends.</p>

        <p>This spring marks the 14th year Liz’s family and friends have raffled a handmade quilt to assist the scholarship in its mission to support talented young architecture students.  In addition to the almost $47,000 raised by this raffle, the scholarship also receives funding from direct donations and from the sale of cards handmade by Liz’s mother, Veronica.</p>

                <h2>About Liz</h2>

                <p>Liz was a beautiful, intelligent, and talented young woman.  Architecture was her passion, as it combined her talents and interest in art, design, and building.  Her smile was pure sunshine!  Liz worked hard and excelled in her studies while helping others understand the field she loved.</p>

                <p>Liz’s years at Washington University in St Louis were some of her happiest and most fulfilling.  After graduating cum laude in 2003 with a BS in Architecture, Liz began the master’s degree program in landscape architecture at the University of Pennsylvania.</p>

                <figure id="drawing-img"><img src="assets/img/drawing.jpg?v=2025" alt="A drawing by Liz" /></figure>

                <p>Shortly after beginning her graduate studies, Liz was diagnosed with brain cancer.  While courageously pursuing treatment for nineteen months, she stayed focused on her passion while working part-time at Astorino Associates in Pittsburgh.  Although Liz died in April 2005, the joy she had for life and architecture continues on in all the lives she touched.</p>

                <h2>The Scholarship</h2>

                <p>Jonathan and Veronica Schmerling and their son, Bruce, chose to honor Liz’s memory by establishing the Elizabeth S. Schmerling Endowed Scholarship at the Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts at Washington University.  “Given the wonderful education she acquired at Wash U and her love for the university, we determined that establishing the scholarship fund to award to deserving and accomplished young students was the most appropriate way to honor and remember our daughter,” Jonathan explains.</p>

                <p>Since 2005, the scholarship has grown through the gifts of family and friends.  Between one and three scholarships may be awarded annually, as determined by a committee of four faculty members.  Selection is based on superior academic performance and scholarship, innovative approaches to the science and art of architecture, and a commitment to the study and understanding of architecture. Recipients serve as an inspiration to both peers and professors.</p>

                <p>For award recipients and direct donations, please visit the <a href="https://samfoxschool.wustl.edu/the-school/support-sam-fox-school/scholarship-support/schmerling-endowed-scholarship">Sam Fox School website</a>.</p>

                <p>Come to find out, Gustav Klimt was a favorite artist of Liz and Veronica. About a month after I heard this, I found an entire collection of fabric based on Klimt’s art works and his style. Klimt’s work is characterized by gold leaf and colored decoration, spirals and swirls. This quilt, a simplified version of the an Irish Chain quilt, is made from that collection! An embroidered tag commemorating the scholarship is on the red, gray and gold fabric backing. The quilt measures approximately 60” x 76”.</p>

                <p>The winner will be drawn using <a href="http://random.org">random.org</a>, notified via email and then posted on this site. All proceeds will be donated to the Elizabeth S Schmerling Endowed Scholarship at the Sam Fox School of Design and Visual Arts at Washington University in St Louis.</p>
